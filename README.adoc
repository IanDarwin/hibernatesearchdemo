= HibernateSearchDemo

This is an example of using Hibernate Search, formerly known as Lucene.

Data entities are written to the database using the JPA API, but Hibernate is the
JPA Provider, so Hibernate Search is fine with that.

Based on my previous work in the AndroidCookbook.com web site back in 2010 and updated
with information from http://hibernate.org/search/documentation/getting-started/.
See the Hibernate.org/search documentation for more information.

The "main program" is structured as a JUnit test so we can remain certain that it's working.
Feel free to use as a template for your application.

== Running

mvn test

or 

Open as and Eclipse project, and run the JUnit tests.

== Windows?

Change the directory from `/tmp` to (say) `C:/temp` in __persistence.xml__.

== Updates?

As always, `git pull` to get the latest version. If there's still a bug,
either send me a `diff -u` listing or, better yet, *github fork* and
send a pull request. Thanks!
